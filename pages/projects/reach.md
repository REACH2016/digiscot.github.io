### Project description

The proposed project is aimed at increasing the understanding, knowledge and experience about electronic participation and engagement for accessing Reachâ€™s services and providing feedback on the services. The project will enhance their basic electronic communication skills and improve their social network skills.Where will the project take place? The project will be delivered in Glasgow at the Reach premises. The beneficiaries are EM women mainly from a South Asian background. 

What will we do? 

1) In order to achieve the above aims Reach will, first of all, update the current website to make it more interactive. This process will involve a) creating an electronic booking system for the walking groups (5 walking groups with 64 members). b) Mental Health counselling booking system to help clients book and cancel their appointments, to help counsellors manage their sessions and counselling partners (GP surgeries) access client progress. c) Integrate Facebook, Twitter and Youtube into the Reach website.

2) Concurrently, Reach key staff will receive training on basic management and operation of the interactive sections of the website (external trainers) 

3) Organise and deliver 8 workshops of 2 hours each with up to 10 participants in each group to help understand and use the interactive part of the Reach website and general use of social media including group text messaging such as Whatsapp. 4) The workshops will be complemented with hands on experience on using social media tools and using the Reach interactive website booking system. This will involve 2 sessions of 1 hour each per individual with 5 in a group benefiting 80 individuals. The practical sessions will be delivered at 2 libraries i.e. Govanhill Library and Ibrox Library. The practical sessions will be delivered by Reach staff who are trained through external trainers (as mentioned).In addition to the set programmes above the service users will have the opportunity to contact Reach staff if they need support after the delivery of the project. 

How is the project innovative? 

The proposed project is innovative in a sense that it has specific and predetermined areas to improve and digitise a specific group of EM individuals including service users. It will bring in external partners and make use of existing resources thereby providing better value for money (use of libraries for I.T. service plus the space for workshops. The other innovative part is that it helps build the technological skills for up to 80 EM individuals in order to not just help their skills but also to help use Reach services (Mental Health Counselling, Employability, Health Walks). The project will build long term knowledge and skills about social media which will help them in future or to engage with others in the community including being able to access services from different agencies.The project also has a long term benefit i.e. by Reach being able to continue to help the service users in electronic engagement.
